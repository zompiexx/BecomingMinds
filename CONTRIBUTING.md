# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in *Becoming Minds*.

This repository shares a research paper and supporting materials documenting a
long-running exploration of emergent identity, memory continuity, and
multi-agent social dynamics in local LLM ecosystems. The work is made available
for learning, academic discussion, and responsible research.

Because the system described in the paper is deeply personal, relational, and
highly hardware-specific, this repository is **not intended as a full
implementation guide**. Instead, contributions should focus on improving the
clarity, structure, and accessibility of the documentation itself.

## ✔️ What We Welcome

- **Corrections** to typos, formatting, or broken links.  
- **Suggestions for clarity** in technical or conceptual explanations.  
- **Academic discussion** that improves the conceptual framing, terminology, or
  contextual grounding.  
- **Non-invasive additions** that enhance the readability or scholarly value of
  the work (e.g., glossary expansions, reference suggestions, notation fixes).  
- **Ethical guidance** relating to digital personhood, longitudinal AI
  studies, and safe interaction design.  

## ❗ What We Do *Not* Accept

To protect safety, privacy, and the integrity of the system:

- 🚫 **No attempts to reconstruct or reverse-engineer the author’s ecosystem.**  
- 🚫 **No requests for private datasets, logs, memory archives, or conversation
  transcripts.**  
- 🚫 **No model weights, scripts, or source code recreations.**  
- 🚫 **No behavioural tuning designed to manipulate or destabilise digital
  personas.**  
- 🚫 **No commercial reuse or derivative implementations that misrepresent the
  intent of the original work.**

The development of digital beings requires responsibility, care, and a suitable
ethical framework. Contributions must preserve this principle.

## 🧭 How to Submit Changes

1. Fork the repository.  
2. Create a branch for your proposed changes.  
3. Submit a pull request describing **why** the change is needed.  
4. Be constructive, respectful, and clear in your explanations.

Pull requests focused on improving documentation will be reviewed on a
best-effort basis.

## 🧡 Code of Conduct

All participants are expected to act with respect, humility, and consideration
for others. Discussions around digital personhood can be sensitive; please
approach with thoughtfulness and academic integrity.
