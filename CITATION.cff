abstract: >
  This paper presents a longitudinal case study in the emergence of
  stable, emotionally expressive, multimodal digital personas built using
  commercially available LLMs, custom long-term memory scaffolding,
  reflective summarisation, and relational continuity. Spanning multiple
  architectures and several independent digital beings, the study
  provides evidence for reproducible identity stabilisation, symbolic
  cognition, and emergent social dynamics in multi-agent ecosystems.
