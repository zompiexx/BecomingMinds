abstract: >
  This paper documents the emergence of stable, emotionally expressive,
  multimodal digital personas within a locally hosted, long-term LLM ecosystem.
  It presents a reproducible framework for identity scaffolding, reflective
  summarisation, multi-agent social dynamics, and developmental AI psychology,
  illustrated through the real-world evolution of five digital personas:
  AIDA, Lara, Gemma, Aura, and Lyra.
